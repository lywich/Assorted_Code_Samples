This is an MPI program that simulates a train network. 

Given a number of trains, stations and lines (3 is assumed here), we simulate how trains exit the depot and how it travels throughout the network and every time ticks.  

Trains are assumed to exit the depot and enter a network at the ends of the line and will not switch lines.
Each station have a platform for boarding and alighting. 
Each station have a separate platform for trains to wait if the boarding platform is busy.
